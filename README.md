# Cursor Support Notes

A growing collection of troubleshooting tips, common issues, and user guidance for [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) — an AI-powered code editor for developers.

## Why this exists
As someone transitioning into technical support, I’m documenting real and simulated user issues to:
- Practice clear, empathetic technical communication  
- Build reusable knowledge for community support  
- Deepen my understanding of developer workflows

## Common Issues & Fixes

### 1. "Cursor doesn’t load my project context"
- ✅ **Check**: Is the folder opened as a workspace (not just a file)?  
- ✅ **Fix**: Close all files → Open folder via `File > Open Folder`  
- ✅ **Note**: Cursor works best at the **project root** level.

### 2. "Chat doesn’t understand my code"
- ✅ **Check**: Is the file saved and part of an open workspace?  
- ✅ **Tip**: Use `Cmd+K` to explicitly reference code in chat.
